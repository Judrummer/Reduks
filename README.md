# Reduks: a port of Reduxjs for Kotlin+Android

This library was started as a fork of https://github.com/brianegan/bansa.

While bansa is focused on Java, Reduks is totally focused on making the best, fully battery included port of reduxjs for Kotlin+Android.
it currently has the following features that bansa misses.

 - RxJava+RxAndroid support
 
 - Promise middleware based on kovenant promises (http://kovenant.komponents.nl/)
 
 - Thunk middleware
 
 - Thread safe action dispatch from multiple threads, in my implementation of State store based on Kovenant promises
  (see https://github.com/beyondeye/Reduks/blob/master/reduks-kovenant/src/main/kotlin/com/beyondeye/reduks/KovenantStore.kt)
   see also this issue in original bansa repository: [Is it safe to call dispatch from multiple threads](https://github.com/brianegan/bansa/issues/24)

 - port of reselect library(https://github.com/reactjs/reselect)
 
 - A powerful logger middleware based on a port of https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger, with the text
  formatting engine based on a heavily customized version of https://github.com/orhanobut/logger. 
  The reduks logger middleware allows to print Json diff of subsequent reduks states  thanks to a port to Kotlin of https://github.com/flipkart-incubator/zjsonpatch, with Jackson substituted with Gson and guava dependency removed

 - Support for easily combining multiple reduks modules
 
 - support for saving/restoring store state on activity onSaveInstanceState/onRestoreInstanceState

#An introduction to Reduks
Reduks (similarly to Reduxjs) is basically a simplified Reactive Functional Programming approach for implementing UI for Android

A very good source of material for understanding redux/reduks are [the official reduxjs docs](http://redux.js.org/), but I will try to describe here the main principles, and how they blend with Android and Kotlin

Reduks main components are:

* the __State__: it is basically the same as the Model in the  standard MVC programming paradigm
* State change __subscribers__: their purpose is similar to Controllers in  MVC 
* __Actions__ and __Reducers__: Reducers are (pure)functions that specify how the State change in response to a stream of events (Actions)
* __Middlewares__: additional pluggable layers (functions) on top of Reducers for implementing logic for responding to the stream of events (Actions) or even modify them before they reach the reducers that implement the State change logic.
 Middlewares (together with event change subscribers) have also the main purpose to allow implementing 'side effects', that are prohibited in reducers, that must be pure functions.

There is also an additional component that is called the __Store__ but it is basically nothing more than the implementation details of the "glue" used to connect all the other components.

Its responsibilities are 

* Allows access to the current state
* Allows to send update events to the state  via `dispatch(action)`
* Registers and unregister state change listeners via `subscribe(listener)`

The implementation details of the Store  and their variations can be quite important, but for understanding Reduks, we can start by focusing first on the other components

This is Reduks in brief. let us now discuss it more in detail

##The State
The state is the set of data that uniquely identify the current state of the application. 
Typically in Android, this is the state of the current Activity.

An important requirement for the data inside the state object  is that it is required to be __immutable__, or in other words it is prohibited to update the state directly.

The only way to mutate the state is to send an action via the store dispatch method, to be processed by the registered state reducers(more on this later), that will generate a new updated state. 

The old state must be never modified.

In Kotlin  we will typically implement the state as a data class with all fields defined as val's (immutable)

Example:
```kotlin
data class ActivityState(val email:String, val password:String, val emailConfirmed:Boolean)
```
Why using a data class? Because it makes it easier to implement reducers, thanks to the autogenerated `copy()` method
But if you don't want to use data classes (because they increase method count) you can easily implement the copy() method like this:
```kotlin
fun copy(email: String?=null, password:String?=null, emailConfirmed:Boolean?=null) =
     LoginActivityState(email ?: this.email,  password ?: this.password,  emailConfirmed ?: this.emailConfirmed)
```
###Actions and Reducers
As we mentioned above, whenever we want to change the state of the application we need to send an *Action*  object, that will be processed by the *Reducers*,
that are pure functions that take as input an action object and the current state and outputs a new modified state.
An action object can be literally any object. For example we can define the following actions
```kotlin
class Action {
    class EmailUpdated(val email:String)
    class PasswordUpdated(val pw:String)
    class EmailConfirmed
}
```
or alternatively we can define
```kotlin
class Action(val type:String,val payload:String)

val emailUpdated = Action(type="email",payload="some@email")
val pwUpdated = Action(type="pw",payload="123456")
val emailConfirmed =  Action(type="emailConfirmed")
```
or in many other ways
####Sending an Action
The term used for denoting sending an action for updating the current state is __dispatch__. The [Store interface](./reduks/src/main/kotlin/com/beyondeye/reduks/Store.kt) has a __dispatch__ method
that should be called for this purpose
####Reducers
a sample [Reducer](./reduks/src/main/java/com/beyondeye/reduks/Reducer.java) can be the following 
```kotlin
val reducer = Reducer<ActivityState> { state, action ->
    when(action) {
        is Action.PasswordUpdated -> state.copy(password = action.pw)
        is Action.EmailUpdated -> state.copy(email = action.email,emailConfirmed = false)
        is Action.EmailConfirmed -> state.copy(emailConfirmed = true)
        else -> state
    }
}
```
Notice that `Reducer` is actually a JAVA SAM interface, and we are leveraging a Kotlin feature that allows to automatically convert a lambda to a SAM interface

Reducers must be pure functions, without side-effects except for updating the state. In particular in a reducer you cannot dispatch actions. 
This is one of the most typical things that confuse beginners.

For example let's say that in order to verify the email address at user registration we must

 * make some server api call (that can fail)
 * and then wait for some notification from the server that the user successfully confirmed the email address (or not).
  
So we can think of defining the following actions

* `class LoginApiCalled`
* `class LoginApiFailed`
* `class LoginEmailConfirmed`

It is natural to think, when receiving the action `LoginApiCalled` in the reducer, to add there the relevant logic for this action, namely checking if
   the call failed, and  if the email was confirmed.
    
Another common related  mistake it is to split the logic between multiple store subscribers, for example, in a subscriber that listen for loginApiCalled state changes
to add logic for treating api failed.

If you find yourself in this situation then you should defer dispatching an action when you actually have the result of the whole chain (so in our example dispatching only the action `LoginEmailConfirmed`).
At a later stage you can eventually also split the chain into multiple actions (so that you can update the UI at different stages of the user authentication), 
but always keep the chain logic in the original place. We will discuss later the [Thunk middleware](./reduks/src/main/kotlin/com/beyondeye/reduks/middlewares/ThunkMiddleware.kt)
and [AsyncAction middleware](./reduks-kovenant/src/main/kotlin/com/beyondeye/reduks/middlewares/AsyncActionMiddleWare.kt) that will help you handle these chains of actions better
